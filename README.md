# Github PR Metrics Graphite Exporter

This exporter converts raw GitHub pull request data to time series. The exported data points represent the number of seconds elapsed between the creation of the pull request and the merging of the pull request.

The timestamp is the creation time of the PR.

Exposed metrics name: `prs.time_to_merge`

## Usage

```sh
$ npm install

# Path to the SQLite db file containing the PR data retrieved from GitHub.
$ export PULL_REQUESTS_DATABASE_PATH=data/example.db

$ npm start

# The generated time series will be written to `stdout`.
# prs.time_to_merge 3450 1554125772
# prs.time_to_merge 935617 1553187544
# ...
```

If you have docker installed, try `make run` to explore the metric, the target which spins up a Graphite stack and injects some [sample data](./data/example.db). The Graphite UI is being exposed on [localhost:80](http://localhost).
